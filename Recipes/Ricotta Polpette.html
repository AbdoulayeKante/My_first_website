  <p>Ricotta is a soft whey cheese, most often made from 
    cowâ€™s milk used in lasagna, dips, cheesecakes and 
    other baking. It is a byproduct of the cheese-making 
    process. When you make cheese, you separate the curds 
    and whey, and make cheese from the curds. Ricotta was 
    traditionally made in Italy from the whey, but is now 
    often made from whole milk. You can buy ricotta, or 
    make it at home.
