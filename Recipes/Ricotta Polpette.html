    <h1>Ricotta Polpette</h1>
    <img src="Ricotta-.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Ricotta is a soft whey cheese, most often made from 
    cowâ€™s milk used in lasagna, dips, cheesecakes and 
    other baking. It is a byproduct of the cheese-making 
    process. When you make cheese, you separate the curds 
    and whey, and make cheese from the curds. Ricotta was 
    traditionally made in Italy from the whey, but is now 
    often made from whole milk. You can buy ricotta, or 
    make it at home.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups whole-milk ricotta cheese (from 2 [15-ounce] containers), drained
        <li> 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon grated garlic (from 2 medium garlic cloves)</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups dry breadcrumbs, plus more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If ricotta is watery, spoon onto a few layers of 
            paper towels and spread to an even layer; place 
            more paper towels on top. Gently press down on 
            ricotta to remove excess moisture. Remove and 
            discard top layer of paper towels. Lift paper 
            towel by the sides and dump ricotta into a large 
            bowl, using paper towel to shake leftover pieces 
            of ricotta into bowl. Stir in eggs, Parmesan 
            cheese, basil, salt, pepper, and garlic until 
            thoroughly blended and smooth. Stir in breadcrumbs
            until combined. (Depending on ricotta, mixture may 
            be loose but should be able to shape into balls 
            that hold together. If not, add additional breadcrumbs, 
            1/4 cup at a time, as needed. )</li>
        <li>Shape mixture into 24 balls (about 2 tablespoons each), 
            and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. 
            Refrigerate, uncovered, 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Place garlic, oil, and crushed red pepper flakes in a 
            small saucepan over medium-low. Once garlic starts to 
            sizzle, reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally, 
            until garlic is tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove saucepan 
            from heat, and mash garlic cloves using a fork. Transfer 
            garlic mixture to a large Dutch oven, and stir in tomatoes, 
            basil, water, and salt. Bring to a simmer over medium. 
            Simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 
            12 to 15 minutes, reducing heat to low as needed to prevent 
            boiling.</li>
        <li>Stir Tomato Sauce, and immediately add Ricotta Polpette to 
            simmering sauce. Cover and reduce heat to low. Cook, 
            gently shaking Dutch oven occasionally, until polpette are 
            tender and cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from 
            heat.</li>
        <li>Using a serving spoon, divide polpette and sauce evenly 
            among 4 shallow bowls. Drizzle with additional oil, and 
            sprinkle with additional Parmesan cheese. Garnish with 
            small basil leaves.</li>
